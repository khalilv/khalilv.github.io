                This was a topics class I took during my fourth year at McGill. The topic for that semester was
                Information Privacy and Security. We followed the book <a
                    href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/3384141" target="_blank">Information Privacy Engineering
                    and Privacy by Design</a> as well as had in-class discussions, personal and group projects, and
                guest speakers. Some of the important topics we covered are listed below.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        PII (Personally Identifiable Information) - <i>what it is, what it is not, sources of PII,
                            quasi-identifiers,
                            personal data vs PII
                        </i>

                    <li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We also had three assignments throughout the course. The first was a blog style article about privacy
                threats, privacy controls, and privacy best practices for an android application of our choosing. We got
                to develop the app and write the article from scratch and we (my group) chose to do ours on <a
                    href="https://github.com/DMurray21/COMP599_A1_amplify#storing-sensitive-user-data"
                    target="_blank">storing sensitive user data through an android application</a>. The second assignment was an
                in-depth analysis and presentation of a privacy focussed research paper. I chose to do mine on <a
                    href="https://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2012/proceedings/a3_Felt.pdf" target="_blank">Android
                    Permissions: User Attention, Comprehension, and Behavior</a> by Adrienne Porter Felt et al. The
                final assignment was an in-depth privacy analysis of a real-world, open-source, android application. For
                this assigment my group chose the android application <a
                    href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dummydomain.yetanothercallblocker/" target="_blank">Yet
                    Another Call Blocker</a>. Overall this was a great course with super interesting topics and
                assignments. It was a great introduction to the world of information privacy and cybersecurity, and it definetely sparked further reading and research in the area.
