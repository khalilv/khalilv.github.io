        <p>
            I am a fifth year student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at McGill University. I was
            born and raised in Vancouver, BC and moved out to Montreal in 2017 for school. My plan starting
            out was to pursue a degree in physics and mathematics. However, during my first semseter at McGill I took a
            <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-202" target="_blank">Foundations of
                Programming</a> course and quickly
            switched my focus.
            I chose to continue with mathematics
            as well
            because I was always a strong student in the area and believed it would aid my
            programming and problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since starting at McGill, I have had the privelege to explore many areas of computer science through
            my courses, proffesional experience, and projects. I took the time to build this website to
            highlight some of this work, but mostly to share my love and interest for
            computer science and technology.
