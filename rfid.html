                    <p>This RFID touchless checkout system was the flagship product of Dynamic Integration
                        Technologies, a startup that I co-founded with a close friend <a
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shakil-jiwa" , target="_blank">Shakil Jiwa</a>. The
                        journey began
                        in the summer of 2020 when both of us found our internships canceled due to the COVID-19
                        pandemic. It was during this time that Shakil was introduced to UHF RFID technology by a
                        colleague. The idea that this technology could uniquely identify tagged items without requiring
                        a direct line of sight and read up to 1000 items per second intrigued us, even though we had
                        minimal background in the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our initial experiments were promising, and with the growing demand for touchless technology, we
                        conceptualized a touchless checkout and inventory management system using UHF RFID technology.
                        We took our vision and transformed it into a reality in Shakil's apartment, tagging various
                        items such as books, food, and clothing. Our goal was to read all these items simultaneously as
                        the user approached a checkout screen. The aim was to eliminate the need for users to
                        individually scan each barcode, offering a touchless and efficient checkout process.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        As we delved deeper into our experiments, we began to grasp the potential of UHF RFID readers,
                        as well as the inherent limitations. For instance, the accuracy of readings depended on the type
                        of object. Bags filled with clothes and books consistently achieved 100% accuracy in our trials,
                        even with up to 50 items per bag. However, when items made of metal or liquid were present,
                        accuracy
                        dropped. This limitation is a known issue with UHF RFID technology. Special tags were available
                        to mitigate this problem, but they were more expensive than the standard tags, which cost around
                        $0.07 each. When dealing with hundreds or thousands of items in a store, this could
                        significantly impact the cost-effectiveness of the system. Another significant limitation was
                        the tagging process itself. To make the system work, RFID tags had to be affixed to each item,
                        similar to barcodes. This tagging process had to be done at the store level, as it wasn't
                        currently performed at the supplier level, and this approach wouldn't scale well with an
                        increasing volume of stock. Despite these limitations, we remained committed to the idea of an
                        RFID-based touchless checkout system and the promising potential of RFID technology as a whole
                        for various
                        applications.

                    <p>
                        A few months later, we presented our idea and prototype to a venture capitalist in Ontario,
                        hoping for an evaluation and a chance to pilot our concept in a retail store. By this point, we
                        had acquired all the necessary hardware and developed an API to communicate with the reader,
                        making it easy to visualize scanned items. During our pitch to the VC, he displayed a keen
                        interest, although he didn't fully grasp the limitations and potential use cases of our idea.
                        Halfway through the meeting, he drove us to a home hardware and introduced us to the store
                        owner, and before we knew it, we had a
                        store willing to test our system, a promise of funding, and the backing of the venture
                        capitalist. While this was an incredible opportunity, it came with challenges. Our system
                        realistically couldn't function optimally in a hardware store due to the types of materials
                        involved, which made reading accurately difficult. Additionally, the volume of incoming items
                        posed a
                        significant hurdle, as tagging them all would require a major operational change. We raised
                        these concerns during the meeting, but sometimes in the world of startups, you have to seize the
                        opportunities that present themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the following months, we established a testbed with approximately 100 random items from the
                        hardware store, including hardware tools and paint cans which we knew would be difficult. We
                        developed a comprehensive checkout
                        system comprising:

                    <ul>
                        <li>A ThingMagic Sargas 2-Port UHF RFID Reader</li>
                        <li>Two RFID antennas strategically positioned to maximize coverage </li>
                        <li>A handheld RFID tag writer</li>
                        <li>A tablet for use as the checkout screen</li>
                        <li>An Android application for easily writing UPC codes to RFID tags</li>
                        <li>An API for communication with the RFID reader to initiate and terminate scanning</li>
                        <li>An ultrasound sensor to trigger scanning as the user approaches the checkout screen</li>
                        <li> A front-end interface for visualizing scanned items in a user-friendly format and
                            simulating a
                            touchless payment interface</li>
                    </ul>
                    With this system, we achieved a 100% success rate on all items in our testbed, provided that
                    each cart or bag contained 30 items or fewer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, our progress coincided with a worsening COVID situation, particularly in eastern
                        Canada. The home hardware shut down shortly after our initial system iteration, forcing us to
                        return to testing at Shakil's house. As time passed, and with no clear end to the lockdown in
                        sight, our relationship with the venture capitalist began to deteriorate. He still struggled to
                        understand the limitations of our system and insisted on making it work specifically for the
                        hardware store before investing, despite our recommendation to shift the pilot to a more
                        suitable store, like a local clothing or sports store. During this period, we explored other
                        opportunities, but many stores, especially smaller local ones, were either locked down or facing
                        staff shortages. Gradually, without explicitly saying it, both of us shifted our focus back to
                        our studies, as we were still pursuing our
                        bachelor's degrees.

                        A few months later, Shakil was accepted into a Ph.D. program at UC Irvine, and I secured a
                        position as a Software Developer at CloudOps. This just about marked the end of our
                        entrepreneurial
                        venture. Most of the technology remains in my apartment in Montreal, but it has been years since
                        we last worked on it. Dynamic Integration, the company we established for this project, has
                        since been dissolved, as both of us are now in graduate school pursuing higher education and
                        a different
                        scope of work.

                <div class="list-item-content">
                    <p>On paper this may be classified as a <i>failed</i> startup but when I look back on the experience, for
                        me it was anything but that. Beyond the skills and experience I gained, what I cherish most is
                        the amount of fun I
                        had working on this project with Shakil.
                        To conceive an idea, delve into technology we were
                        unfamiliar with, build a working prototype from scratch, pitch and market it to a venture
                        capitalist, and
                        test
                        it with real products at the age of 21, all while balancing our studies, is a tremendous
                        personal
                        success, even if we did come out in the negatives money wise. It gives me hope that I'll
                        do okay in life and opportunities can come out of nowhere, you just have to be open and willing
                        to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a final thought, it's funny how COVID both catalyzed the start of this venture and played a
                        significant role in its end. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading, and enjoy the
                        media.</p>
