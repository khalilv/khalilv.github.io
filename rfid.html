                <b><span class="text-lg">Details</span></b>
                <p class="text-base">This RFID touchless checkout system was the core product of Dynamic Integration
                    Technologies, a startup I co-founded with my close friend, Shakil Jiwa. We started in the summer of
                    2020, when both of our internships were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shakil was introduced
                    to UHF RFID technology by a colleague, and, despite our limited background in the field, we were
                    interested in its ability to uniquely identify tagged items without requiring a direct line of sight
                    and to read up to 1,000 items per second.
                </p>
                <p class="text-base">Our early tests were successful, and with the growing demand for touchless
                    technology during the pandemic, we designed a touchless checkout and inventory management system
                    using UHF RFID technology. We built the prototype in Shakil's apartment, tagging items like books,
                    food, and clothing. Our goal was to scan all items in a cart simultaneously as a user approached a
                    checkout screen, eliminating the need to scan each barcode individually. Unlike the Amazon Fresh
                    smart grocery cart, which scans items as users add them to their carts, our system scans the entire
                    cart at checkout. This approach preserves the traditional shopping experience, allowing customers to
                    freely add or remove items from their carts. The only difference is that the items are automatically
                    populated on a checkout screen, eliminating the need for manual barcode scanning.
                </p>
                <p class="text-base">
                    As we conducted more experiments, we began to see both the potential and the inherent limitations of
                    UHF RFID technology. For example, the accuracy of readings depended heavily on the types of objects
                    in a cart. Carts filled with clothes and books consistently achieved 100% accuracy in our trials,
                    even with over 50 items per cart. However, when metal or liquid-containing items were present,
                    accuracy dropped significantly—a known limitation of UHF RFID technology. Special tags are available
                    to mitigate this problem, but they are considerably more expensive than standard tags, which cost
                    around $0.07 each. In a store handling hundreds or thousands of items, these costs could
                    substantially undermine the feasibility of the system. Another limitation was the tagging process
                    itself. RFID tags had to be placed on each item, much like a barcode. This tagging had to be done
                    either at the store level or by the supplier, and changing operations at that scale is challenging,
                    especially for stores with large inventories. Despite these limitations, we were committed to the
                    idea of an RFID-based touchless checkout system and believed it held promise. We just needed to find
                    the right niche.

                </p>
                <p class="text-base">
                    A few months later, we presented our idea and prototype to a VC in Ontario, hoping to secure seed
                    funding and a pilot project in a retail store. By this stage, we had assembled all the necessary
                    hardware and developed an API to communicate with the reader, making it easy to visualize scanned
                    items. During our pitch, the VC showed considerable interest, though he didn’t seem to fully grasp
                    the system’s limitations and its most suitable use cases (we are not marketing experts by any
                    means). After the meeting, he drove us to a local hardware store and introduced us to the owner.
                    Before we knew it, we had a store willing to test our system, a promise of funding, and the VC’s
                    backing. While this was a great opportunity, it came with some challenges. Our system realistically
                    couldn't function optimally in a hardware store due to the prevalence of metal and liquid materials.
                    Additionally, the sheer volume of items posed a significant hurdle, as tagging them all would
                    require a major operational change. We did raise these concerns during the meeting, but sometimes
                    you have to take what you can get, and we didn't have other options at that point.
                </p>
                <p class="text-base">
                    Over the following months, we established a testbed with approximately 100 items from the hardware
                    store, including challenging items like hardware tools and paint cans. Our checkout system was built
                    using:
                </p>
                <ul class="nested-list">
                    <li>A ThingMagic Sargas 2-Port UHF RFID reader.</li>
                    <li>Two strategically positioned RFID antennas to maximize coverage.</li>
                    <li>A handheld RFID tag writer.</li>
                    <li>A tablet as the checkout screen.</li>
                    <li>An Android application for writing UPCs to tags.</li>
                    <li>An API for initiating and terminating scans with the RFID reader.</li>
                    <li>An ultrasound sensor to automatically start scanning as a user approaches the checkout
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>A front-end interface for visualizing scanned items and simulating a touchless payment
                        process.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-base"> With this system, we achieved a 100% success rate for all items in our testbed,
                    provided each cart
                    or bag contained 30 items or fewer.
                </p>
                <p class="text-base">
                    Unfortunately, our progress coincided with a worsening COVID-19 situation. The hardware store shut
                    down, forcing us to halt testing. As the lockdowns persisted with no clear end in sight, we began
                    experiencing challenges with our VC. He continued to struggle with the system’s limitations and
                    insisted on making it work specifically for the hardware store, despite our recommendations to shift
                    the pilot to a more suitable environment, such as a clothing or sports store. During this time, we
                    explored other opportunities, but most stores, especially smaller local ones, were either shut down
                    or facing staff shortages. Gradually, without formally deciding to, both of us shifted our focus
                    back to our studies, as we were both still completing our undergraduate degrees.

                    A few months later, Shakil was accepted into a Ph.D. program at UC Irvine, and I secured a position
                    as a Software Developer at CloudOps. This pretty much marked the end of Dynamic Integration. Most of
                    the hardware remains in my apartment, but it's been years since we last worked on it. Dynamic
                    Integration, the company we created for this project, has since been dissolved, as both of us have
                    moved on to graduate studies and a new scope of work.

                <b><span class="text-lg">Takeaways</span></b>
                <p class="text-base">On paper, this might be classified as a <i>failed</i> startup, but looking back, I
                    see it
                    as anything but that. Aside from the skills and experience I gained, I had a lot of fun working on
                    this project with Shakil. From having the idea to building a working prototype, pitching it to a
                    venture capitalist, and testing it in a hardware store with real products—all while balancing our
                    studies—was quite the opportunity, even if we ended up in the negatives financially. I realized that
                    opportunities can come out of nowhere; you just have to be open-minded and willing to try, making
                    sure to have some fun along the way. Anyway, if you've made it this far, thanks for reading.
