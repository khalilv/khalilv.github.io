                    <p>This RFID touchless checkout system was the core product of Dynamic Integration Technologies, a
                        startup I co-founded with my close friend, Shakil Jiwa. We started in the summer of 2020 when
                        both of us had our internships canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shakil was introduced to
                        UHF RFID technology by a colleague, and, despite our limited background in the field, we were
                        intrigued by its ability to uniquely identify tagged items without requiring a direct line of
                        sight and to read up to 1,000 items per second.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our early tests were successful, and with the growing demand for touchless technology during the
                        pandemic, we designed a touchless checkout and inventory management system using this UHF RFID
                        technology. We built the prototype in Shakil's apartment, tagging items like books, food, and
                        clothing. Our goal was to scan all items in a cart simultaneously as a user approached a
                        checkout screen, eliminating the need to scan each barcode individually. Unlike the Amazon Fresh
                        smart grocery cart, which scans items as users add them to their carts, our system scans the
                        entire cart at checkout. This approach preserves the traditional shopping experience, allowing
                        customers to freely add or remove items from their carts. The only difference is that the items
                        are automatically populated on a checkout screen, eliminating the need for manual barcode
                        scanning.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        As we conducted more experiments, we began to see both the potential and the inherent
                        limitations of UHF RFID technology. For example, the accuracy of readings depended heavily on
                        the types of objects in a cart. Carts filled with clothes and books consistently achieved 100%
                        accuracy in our trials, even with over 50 items per cart. However, when items made of metal or
                        containing liquids were present, accuracy dropped significantly—a known limitation of UHF RFID
                        technology. Special tags are available to mitigate this problem, but they are considerably more
                        expensive than standard tags, which cost around $0.07 each. In a store handling hundreds or
                        thousands of items, these costs could substantially hinder the feasibility of the system.
                        Another limitation was the tagging process itself. RFID tags had to be placed on each item, much
                        like a barcode. This tagging had to be done either at the store level or by the supplier, and
                        changing operations at that scale is challenging, especially for stores with large inventories.
                        Despite these limitations, we were committed to the idea of an RFID-based touchless checkout
                        system and believe it held promise. We just needed to find the right niche.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few months later, we presented our idea and prototype to a VC in Ontario, hoping to secure
                        seed funding and a chance to pilot our project in a retail store. By this stage, we had
                        assembled all the necessary hardware and developed an API to communicate with the reader, making
                        it easy to visualize scanned items. During our pitch, the VC showed considerable interest,
                        though he didn’t seem to fully grasp the system’s limitations and its most suitable use cases.
                        After the meeting, he drove us to a local hardware store and introduced us to the owner. Before
                        we knew it, we had a store willing to test our system, a promise of funding, and the VC’s
                        backing. While this was a great opportunity, it came with some challenges. Our system
                        realistically couldn't function optimally in a hardware store due to the prevalence of metal and
                        liquid materials. Additionally, the sheer volume of items posed a significant hurdle, as tagging
                        all of them would require a significant operational change. We did raise these concerns during
                        the meeting, but sometimes you have to take what you can get and we didn't have any other
                        options at that point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the following months, we established a testbed with approximately 100 items from the
                        hardware store, including challenging items like hardware tools and paint cans. Our checkout
                        system was built using:

                    <ul>
                        <li>A ThingMagic Sargas 2-Port UHF RFID reader.</li>
                        <li>Two strategically positioned RFID antennas to maximize coverage.</li>
                        <li>A handheld RFID tag writer.</li>
                        <li>A tablet as the checkout screen.</li>
                        <li>An android application for writing UPCs to tags.</li>
                        <li>An API for initiating and terminating scans with the RFID reader.</li>
                        <li>An ultrasound sensor to automatically start scanning as a user approaches the checkout
                            screen.</li>
                        <li>A front-end interface for visualizing scanned items and simulating a touchless payment
                            process.</li>
                    </ul>
                    With this system, we achieved a 100% success rate for all items in our testbed, provided each cart
                    or bag contained 30 items or fewer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, our progress coincided with a worsening COVID-19 situation, particularly in
                        eastern Canada. The hardware store shut down, forcing us to halt testing. As the lockdowns
                        persisted with no clear end in sight, we began experiencing challenges with our VC. He continued
                        to struggle with the system’s limitations and insisted on making it work specifically for the
                        hardware store, despite our recommendations to shift the pilot to a more suitable environment,
                        such as a clothing or sports store. During this time, we explored other opportunities, but most
                        stores, especially smaller local ones, were either shut down or facing staff shortages.
                        Gradually, without formally deciding to, both of us shifted our focus back to our studies, as we
                        were still completing our bachelor’s degrees.

                        A few months later, Shakil was accepted into a Ph.D. program at UC Irvine, and I secured a
                        position as a Software Developer at CloudOps. This pretty much marked the end of our venture.
                        Most of the hardware remains in my apartment in Montreal, but it has been years now since we
                        last worked on it. Dynamic Integration, the company we created for this project, has since been
                        dissolved, as both of us have moved on to graduate studies and a new scope of work.

                    <p>On paper, this might be classified as a <i>failed</i> startup, but looking back, I see it as anything
                        but that. Aside from the skills and experience I gained, I had so much fun working on this
                        project with Shakil. From having the idea to building a working prototype, pitching it to a
                        venture capitalist, and testing it in a hardware store with real products—all while balancing
                        our studies—was quite the opportunity, even if we ended up in the negatives financially. I
                        learned that opportunities can come out of nowhere, you just have to be open-minded and willing
                        to try. Anyways, if you've made it this far, thanks for reading.
