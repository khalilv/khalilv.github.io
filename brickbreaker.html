                    <p>I made this game in the summer of 2019. It was my first introduction to javascript, HTML and CSS.
                        I started by watching a youtube
                        video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0" target="_blank">Intro to Game Development with
                            JavaScript</a>
                        and by following instructions in an MDN document <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript" target="_blank">2D
                            breakout game using pure JavaScript.</a>
                        After some hours of work, to my surprise I had a working brick breaker game that I could play on
                        my browser. That was my first taste into the world of
                        front-end development and it was shocking to me that I could build something like that given the
                        limited knowledge and experience I had.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, at that point, I wasn't fully satisfied with my work. Given I mostly just followed
                        instructions in the video and in the document I felt I needed to do a little more before
                        concluding the project. Over the next few days I took some time to add extra features to personalize and improve my version of the game. 
                        Some features I added were: increased ball speed and smaller paddle width as the game progresses, 
                        pausing the game on new levels and on a new life, 5 level variations, and a more releastic rebounding of the ball off bricks. 
                        I also added custom styling to make the game look my own. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This game was a great learning experience for me to understand how javascript, HTML and CSS work together 
                        and I am glad I took the time to build this game. I use javascript, HTML and CSS almost everyday now - at work and for personal projects - 
                        and its always funny to look back and see where it all started. Hope you enjoy the game :)
