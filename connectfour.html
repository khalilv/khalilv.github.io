                    <p>This game was an academic project I completed during my second semester at McGill. It is a simple
                        connect four game that you can play on the command line against the computer. It was made using
                        Object Oriented Programming in Java. What is cool about this game is that the computer checks
                        two moves ahead to see if it has a winning sequence, otherwise its move is dependent on the
                        users. This makes the game surprisingly difficult to beat on the first few attempts, and it was
                        a
                        weird feeling when I found myself struggling to beat a game that I created.

                        This was the second
                        game I coded in Java (the first was Tic-Tac-Toe), and it required a bit more complex logic to
                        add this layer of difficulty. It was definitely enjoyable to make and even more so to play.
