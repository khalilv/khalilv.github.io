                    <p>This project stemmed from my passion and previous experience working with IoT systems. It
                        started in the summer of 2021, when I was looking for a side project to work on after my 9-5. After speaking to my friend who is a working
                        sous-chef in Vancouver, and having him explain how much food his restaurant wastes due to a
                        lack of temperature monitoring, I realized I could build a system to help with this problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In particular, I wanted to build lightweight modules which would automatically take temperature
                        and humidity readings in a given time interval, and export them to a server for
                        analysis. These modules would be placed on food containers (specifically meat) in the
                        restaurant to save busy employees the hassle of manually taking readings every 4 hours.
                        Instead,
                        employees would simply be able to view the readings on a tablet in the
                        kitchen and would get notified if the values exceed set thresholds.
                    </p>
                    <p> I am currently in the process of building a prototype for this project. I have ordered all the
                        hardware
                        and have a server est up to receive and save sensor readings. I still need to
                        finish putting together the module, figure out a way to extend the battery life, and add
                        functionality to view real-time temperature and humidity readings on the server. I hope to be finished this
                        project by the end of summer 2022, at which point my friend will pilot it in his restaurant.
